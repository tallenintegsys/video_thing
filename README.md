A Linux Kernel Module (driver)

This is just a prototype it's not production code!
(some wag complained that I'm not checking return values on stuff)

This is a skeleton of a Linux kernel module (a driver if you like) that I've used for various things over the years. Initially I stuck it up here for safe keeping (I had various versions of it as part of various projects); but now I'm going to put it to work to create a DIY GPU acceleration driver. I'll probably start with a simple VGA card and figure out how to use the frame buffer. Ultimately I want to figure out how to do GPU acceleration the hard way on a commodity graphics card. Using something like CUDA is way too easy, I want to know what's really going on!
